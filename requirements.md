# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a centralized web dashboard that aggregates and displays AWS resources from multiple AWS accounts in a single, unified interface. The dashboard will provide visibility into EC2 instances, VPCs, RDS databases, S3 buckets, ECS services, EKS clusters, and other AWS resources across different accounts, enabling users to monitor and manage their multi-account AWS infrastructure from one location.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to view all my AWS resources across multiple accounts in a single dashboard, so that I can quickly assess the state of my entire infrastructure without switching between accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display resources from all configured AWS accounts
2. WHEN resources are loaded THEN the system SHALL group resources by account and service type
3. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show resource counts and status summaries for each account
4. IF an account is inaccessible THEN the system SHALL display an error indicator for that account while showing other accounts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cloud administrator, I want to configure multiple AWS accounts for monitoring, so that I can centralize visibility across my organization's AWS infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring accounts THEN the system SHALL allow adding AWS accounts using IAM roles or access keys
2. WHEN an account is added THEN the system SHALL validate the credentials and permissions
3. WHEN account configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL store credentials securely
4. IF credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent saving

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to see detailed information about EC2 instances, VPCs, RDS databases, S3 buckets, ECS services, and EKS clusters, so that I can monitor the health and configuration of my infrastructure components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing EC2 resources THEN the system SHALL display instance ID, state, type, region, and tags
2. WHEN viewing VPC resources THEN the system SHALL show VPC ID, CIDR blocks, subnets, and associated resources
3. WHEN viewing RDS resources THEN the system SHALL display database identifier, engine, status, and connection details
4. WHEN viewing S3 resources THEN the system SHALL show bucket names, regions, and basic metadata
5. WHEN viewing ECS resources THEN the system SHALL display cluster names, service status, and task counts
6. WHEN viewing EKS resources THEN the system SHALL show cluster names, versions, node groups, and status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to refresh automatically and allow manual refresh, so that I can see up-to-date information about my AWS resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is loaded THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh resource data every 5 minutes
2. WHEN the user clicks refresh THEN the system SHALL immediately fetch updated resource information
3. WHEN data is being refreshed THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
4. IF refresh fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages while preserving previously loaded data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter and search resources across accounts, so that I can quickly find specific resources or resource types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the search function THEN the system SHALL allow searching by resource name, ID, or tags
2. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by account, region, service type, and resource status
3. WHEN filtering by account THEN the system SHALL show a dropdown with all configured accounts and allow single or multiple account selection
4. WHEN filtering by region THEN the system SHALL show a dropdown with all AWS regions and allow single or multiple region selection
5. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL update the display in real-time
6. WHEN clearing filters THEN the system SHALL restore the full resource view
7. WHEN multiple filters are active THEN the system SHALL apply them with AND logic (e.g., specific account AND specific region)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want the dashboard to handle AWS credentials securely, so that I can safely monitor multiple accounts without exposing sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data at rest
2. WHEN accessing AWS APIs THEN the system SHALL use least-privilege IAM policies
3. WHEN displaying credentials THEN the system SHALL mask sensitive information in the UI
4. IF credential rotation occurs THEN the system SHALL handle authentication failures gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to be responsive and performant, so that I can efficiently monitor my infrastructure from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing from mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout
2. WHEN loading large numbers of resources THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtualization
3. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display initial data within 3 seconds
4. IF network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and error handling
